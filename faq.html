                                        <div class="ques_1" style="display: none;">
                                            <p>Services are designated as "Best Sellers" based on their popularity and positive feedback from our clients. This label is used to highlight services that have consistently delivered excellent results and value to our users. It helps you easily identify and choose services that have been highly regarded by other clients, making it simpler to select the right service for your needs on our site.

                                        <div class="ques_1" style="display: none;">
                                            <p>Service names are structured as follows: "Service Type [Start Time - Speed/Day - Maximum] [Refill Period]."<br>
                                            For example, if you see a service named "Youtube Views [1h - 1m/d - 5m] [r30]," it means:<br>
                                            "Youtube Views" is the type of service. <br>
                                            "1h" indicates a 1-hour start time for the service. <br>
                                            "1m/d" represents a speed of 1 million views per day. <br>
                                            "5m" denotes a maximum of 5 million views.<br>
                                            "[r30]" signifies that there is a 30-day refill period for this service. 
                                            <br>In summary, the service name provides essential details about the service type, start time, daily speed, maximum quantity, and any refill periods associated with it.

                                            <p>Emojis in a service name serve as visual indicators to provide quick information about the service:<br>
â™» indicates that the service has the ""Refill Button"" enabled, allowing for potential refills.<br>
â›” signifies that the ""Cancellation Button"" is enabled, allowing you to cancel the service if needed.<br>
âš¡ denotes ""Fast Start Services,"" indicating that the service has a rapid initiation.<br>

                                            <p>A refill is a service provided to address potential drops in social media metrics. Social media platforms frequently conduct updates to remove inactive or spam accounts. These updates can occasionally result in a decrease in the numbers associated with your order, such as followers or likes.<br>
                                            If such a drop occurs and your order falls within the specified refill period, all you need to do is open a support ticket with your Order ID. We will then replenish your order at no additional cost.<br>
                                            For example, if you see "[r30]" in the service description, it means that we will offer free refills for the next 30 days after your order was initially created to ensure the stability of your metrics.

                                            <p>To place an order, follow these simple steps:<br>
<br>
1.Category: Begin by selecting the social media platform or account you wish to boost.<br>
2. Service: Choose the specific service type that aligns with your goals.<br>
3. Description: Review the service description, which provides essential information such as service quality, start time, daily speed, minimum and maximum order quantities, refill warranty, and the price per 1,000 units.<br>
4. Details: Take note of any additional details, samples, or relevant information provided about the selected service.<br>
5. Link: Enter the correct username or page link associated with your social media account. Ensure the accuracy of this information, as changes may not be possible once the order is placed.<br>
6. Quantity: Specify the desired quantity for your order. Avoid using commas or dots in quantity values; for example, use "1000" instead of "1,000."<br>
7. Dripfeed: If you wish to place the same order multiple times automatically, click this option.<br>
<br>
By following these steps, you can successfully place an order to boost your social media presence or engagement.

                                            <p>To utilize the Mass Order feature, follow these steps: <br>
1. Retrieve the Service ID: Visit our Services List at https://followiz.com/services to find the Service ID for the service you wish to use. <br>
2. Format Your Order: On each line, create an order entry using the following format: Service ID | Link | Quantity. For example, if you want to add 1000 Instagram followers to three different accounts (abcd, asdf, qwer) using Service ID 885, your entries would look like this:<br>
885|abcd|1000 <br>
885|asdf|1000 <br>
885|qwer|1000 <br>
<br>
By following this format, you can efficiently use the Mass Order feature to place multiple orders for different accounts and quantities, streamlining the process for your convenience.

                                        <div class="ques_1" style="display: none;">
                                            <p>Drip Feed is a service we offer that allows you to automatically place the same order multiple times over a specified interval. Here's how it works:<br>
<br>
Quantity: This represents the total quantity of the service you want.<br>
Runs: The number of times you want the order to be repeated.<br>
Interval: The time gap between each repetition.<br>
For example, if you order 100 likes with "Runs: 10" and "Interval: 30," it means you'll receive 100 likes every 30 minutes, resulting in a total of 1000 likes.<br>
<br>
However, it's crucial to adhere to a few guidelines:<br>
<br>
Never exceed the maximum quantity specified in the service name (Quantity x Runs). For instance, if the service's maximum is 4000, don't set "Quantity: 500" and "Run: 10" because it would exceed the service limit (500 x 10 = 5000).<br>
Ensure that the Interval is not set below the actual start time. Some services require a 60-minute start time, so avoid setting an Interval less than this or it may result in order failure.<br>
Please note that the minimum Interval should be at least 4 times the specified start time. Orders not following this rule will not be eligible for refunds.

                                            <p>Refills are an essential part of our service, but there are instances where we may not be able to provide them. One common scenario is when clients place orders with us for accounts that have previously purchased a substantial number of followers from different providers. For instance, if someone orders 1,000 followers for an account with tens or hundreds of thousands of existing followers, it becomes more challenging to maintain stability, and drops may occur due to the large number of previously acquired followers. In such cases, we cannot offer refills for accounts that experience drops below their initial start count.<br>
                                            It's important to consider the existing follower count when placing your order to ensure the best possible outcome.

Typically, it can take anywhere from 1 to 7 working days to fully refill your order. The initial start of the refill process may also vary and can take anywhere from 0 to 48 hours. This initial delay depends on the current server load.<br>
                                            Additionally, in some cases, it might take longer if there is a significant update or change in social media platforms that affects our refill process. Rest assured, our team works diligently to ensure your order is refilled as efficiently as possible.

                                            <p>If your cryptocurrency payment has not been processed automatically after 30 minutes, it's possible that your transaction was "Cancelled" or "Timed Out." This often occurs when the amount of cryptocurrency sent does not match the required amount for the transaction. Coinpayments, our cryptocurrency payment processor, will typically send you a "Payment Time Out" email explaining the issue and outlining the steps to resolve it.<br>
<br>
To avoid such issues in the future, please ensure that you send the correct amount of cryptocurrency (BTC), not USD. The value of cryptocurrency in BTC/USD can fluctuate, and sending the incorrect amount may lead to transaction problems. Double-check the amount before making your next transaction to ensure it matches the required amount specified in BTC.</p>

Enable Two-Step Authentication (2FA): Access your <a href="/account">account settings</a> page and activate Two-Step Authentication (2FA) for an extra layer of security. This will require you to enter a verification code from your mobile app or email when logging in.<br>
<br>
Use a Strong and Unique Password: Create a robust and distinctive password for your Followiz account. Incorporate a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to make it more secure.<br>
<br>
By implementing these measures, you can significantly enhance the protection of your Followiz account.

                                            This means you'll make a profit of $1 for every 1000 units sold on your child panel. It's a straightforward way to generate income by reselling services at a markup.

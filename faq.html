                                            <p>Drip Feed is a service that we are offering so you would be able to put the same order multiple times automatically.<br>
                                            Example:<br>
                                            Quantity:100<br>
                                            Runs: 10<br>
                                            Interval: 30<br>
                                            <br><br>
                                            This will send 100 likes on your post every 30 minutes, in total, you will receive 1000 likes.<br>
                                            Never order more quantity than the maximum which is written on the service name (Quantity x Runs), Example if the service's max is 4000, you don’t put Quantity: 500 and Run: 10, because the total quantity will be 500x10 = 5000 which is bigger than the service max (4000). Also never put the Interval below the actual start time (some services need 60 minutes to start, don’t put Interval less than the service start time or it will cause a fail in your order).<br>
                                            <br><br>
                                            MINIMUM INTERVAL SHOULD BE AT LEAST 4 TIMES THE START TIME.<br>
                                            We will not refund any orders that have not followed this rule.<br>

Coinpayments will send you a "Payment Time Out" email explaining the issue. From there, they will tell you how you will get your funds back. On your next transaction, be sure that you send the right amount of Crypto(BTC), not USD. Crypto(BTC)/USD can fluctuate, which creates that kind of issue.</p>
